<summary>Usage</summary>

#### Python

YOLOv8 may also be used directly in a Python environment, and accepts the same [arguments](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/cfg/) as in the CLI example above:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a model
model = YOLO("yolov8x.yaml")  # build a new model from scratch
model = YOLO("yolov8x.pt")  # load a pretrained model (recommended for training)

# Use the model
model.train(data="data.yaml", epochs=3)  # train the model
metrics = model.val()  # evaluate model performance on the validation set
results = model("https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg")  # predict on an image
path = model.export(format="onnx")  # export the model to ONNX format
```

See YOLOv8 [Python Docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/python) for more examples.

YOLOv8 [Detect](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/detect), [Segment](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/segment) and [Pose](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/pose) models pretrained on the [COCO](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/detect/coco) dataset are available here, as well as YOLOv8 [Classify](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/classify) models pretrained on the [ImageNet](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/classify/imagenet) dataset. [Track](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/track) mode is available for all Detect, Segment and Pose models.
