# AI-Enable-Traffic-Light-Control-System
Increasing population and density cause traffic issues. This project tackles intersection management with AI. Traffic videos are preprocessed and labeled using YOLO model. Training improves vehicle recognition. Testing shows significant results. Implementation includes practical simulation and Arduino-based signal timing.
